        <p>
            I'm not too picky about the way this code is used. I currently have choosen a more
            restrictive license for everything here. I intent to change this later on. I just
            want to be able to firstly have something here to be proud of. Once the site is
            looking decent, I will consider what I want the license to be. I just want to ensure
            I am not forgetting to protect anything of mine, before I actually create it.<br>
            I hope you can respect that, and if you want to borrow something, please do
            contact me!
